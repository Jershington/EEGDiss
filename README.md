Unity3D Myndplay EEG device listener and interpreter

This is a rookie attempt at integrating NEUROSKY's ThinkGearConnector with a unity project. Personally, I am using MYNDPLAY's BLE Headset.
The aim of the project I am currently working on is a Unity Game that uses an EEG headset as a secondary input type for key gameplay elements, such as lifting boxes

While this is my dissertation project, I do not mind other people using this code or project for personal use - and credit will not be sought for by me. However credit will be appreciated!
